	// Note: Weeks 1-3. Comprehensive workout.
	// In phase 1, try to decrease your rest times as each week passes. Example: Letâ€™s say you start out
	// with 90 seconds rest between sets on the 1st week. Try to hit 60 seconds rest time between sets on the
	// 2nd week, and 30 seconds rest time between sets on the 3rd week. If you want more of an advanced
	// phase 1 (home edition), try to circuit train through the first four exercises back to back, with only a 90
	// second rest before starting the next round. After completing the 5 rounds of the first 4 exercises, you will
	// then move onto the other exercises to finish up.
